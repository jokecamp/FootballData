Football (Soccer) Data for Everyone
============

Football/Soccer data for anyone to use. I save them here as I find them or build the files. Data is in mostly csv and json formats.

See [Guide to Football/Soccer data and APIs](http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/guide-to-football-and-soccer-data-and-apis/) for a more complete list of soccer data available online.

**Files and datasets will move and schemas will change. Fork the project if you need a snapshot.**

**Please add your data sets. We need more data.**
